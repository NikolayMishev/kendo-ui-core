# Grid Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the Grid is enabled through:
* [Internationalization]({% slug intl_aspnetcore_grid %})
* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_aspnetcore_grid %})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug rtl_aspnetcore_grid %})

For more information on using localization and right-to-left languages with Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core helpers, refer to the article on [globalization support by Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core]({% slug overview_globalization_core %}).
