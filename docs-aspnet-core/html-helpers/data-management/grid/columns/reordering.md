# Reordering of Columns

The Grid provides options for reordering its columns.

To enable the user to reorder the columns of the Grid by dragging, set the `Reorderable.Columns()` method to `true`. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on implementing column reordering in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core/grid/column-reordering).

         .Reorderable(reorderable => reorderable.Columns(true))
