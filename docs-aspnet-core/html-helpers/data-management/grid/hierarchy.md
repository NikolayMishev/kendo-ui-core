# Hierarchy

The Grid provides options for visualizing the relations between parent and child records by displaying its table data in a hierarchical manner.

To implement hierarchy in the Grid, use the `ClientDetailTemplateId()` method and filter the records in the child table based on the parent key field value. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using hierarchy in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core/grid/hierarchy).
