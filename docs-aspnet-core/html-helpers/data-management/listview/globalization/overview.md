# ListView Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the ListView is enabled through its [right-to-left support]({% slug htmlhelpers_listview_aspnetcore_rtl %}).
