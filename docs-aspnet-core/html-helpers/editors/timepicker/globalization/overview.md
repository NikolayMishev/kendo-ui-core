# TimePicker Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the TimePicker is enabled through:
* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_timepicker_aspnetcore %})
* [Right-to-left support]({% slug rtl_timepicker_aspnetcore %})
